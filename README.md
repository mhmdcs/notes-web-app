# Notes Web App

Yet another notes app made for learning purposes, this is my first crack at a full-blown fullstack web application that uses TypeScript and runs a backend server app using Express.js/Node.js and ReactJS on the front.

To use this on your local machine you'll need to sign up on Atlas' MongoDB and acquire an API key for your database and place it in .env, you'll also need to define a random port number and a random secret key for the cookies session encryption inside .env as well.
